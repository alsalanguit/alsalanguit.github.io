      <h4><br>
        Hello everyone!</h4>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my page and for viewing my work. My name is Andrea Salanguit, I study at Wake Tech
        Community College and specialize in Cybersecurity. </p>
      <p><img src="assets/about_me_pic-2.jpg"

             class="img_float_right">I grew up in a small town called Nasugbu in the Philippines with my parents and two
        sisters. At the age of 15, my family immigrated to Italy which began a challenging period in my life in many
        ways: from having to leave my friends and family, adjusting to an unfamiliar country, learning a new language,
        and adapting to a culture that was very different from the one I knew. While in Italy, I completed my secondary
        education and then spent three years studying linguistics at the <em>Universit√† per Stranieri</em> in Siena,
        Tuscany. It was during this time that I met my now-husband who was visiting on a study abroad from the US. One
        thing led to another and now I find myself once again in a new adventure here in America.</p>
      <p>In my first years in the US, I worked in the service industry. It was a breath of fresh air working in a
        fast-paced environment and interacting with people, especially after being so isolated during the pandemic. It
        was a fitting job for someone like me who was trying to plan their next step in life.</p>
      <p>Serving is a physically and mentally taxing job so after 2 years of doing this, I find myself in need of
        change, so, upon discovering that Wake Tech offered Cybersecurity program, I decided it was best for me to
        pursue school.</p>
      <p>I currently do not precisely know what type of work I will do but I am hoping to have an idea as I go through
        the courses of my degree and learn as much as I can.</p>

    <h4>About my photography:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I got my first starter DSLR camera when I was 15 years old. As someone who has always been interested in art,
        especially in photography, this gave me an opportunity to grow in this field. Eager to learn, I started watching
        tutorial videos and reading about photography and eventually teaching myself how to use editing programs such as
        Adobe Lightroom.</p>
      <p>It brings me a deep level of satisfaction when I see my pictures come to life as I edit them, especially when
        emotions and memories are attached to them. I mostly do landscape photography but I also put myself out of my
        comfort zone by doing something different from time to time. In many of my pictures, you will see my favorite
        muse, my dog Mia.</p>
      <p>Slowly, I am building my portfolio as a photographer. My goal is to one day be able to take pictures manually
        using analogue cameras and have a darkroom of my own.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
